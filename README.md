# Targeted_Cas1_assembly
targeted assemble Cas1 from metagenome bypassing annotating Was proteins from de-novo assemblies
We constructed eight cas1 Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to cover Cas1 diversity and assembled Cas1 directly from metagenomes by a targeted-gene assembler, Xander. 
The eight Xander packages including the HMMs were uploaded here.
