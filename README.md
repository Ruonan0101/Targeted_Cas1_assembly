# Targeted_Cas1_assembly
Targeted assemble Cas1 from metagenome bypassing annotating Cas proteins from de-novo assemblies

We constructed eight Cas1 Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to cover Cas1 diversity and assembled them directly from metagenomes by a targeted-gene assembler, Xander (Wang, Q., et al., 2015). 

The eight Xander packages including the HMMs were uploaded here.
